# Requirements Document

## Introduction

WordPress Static Site Guardian is an enterprise-grade AWS solution that enables static WordPress sites to maintain authentication-protected content areas. The system leverages CloudFront signed cookies, API Gateway, and Lambda functions to provide seamless authentication integration while maintaining the performance benefits of static site hosting.

The solution addresses the challenge faced by WordPress site owners who want to serve their sites statically from S3/CloudFront for performance and security benefits, but still need to protect premium content areas like member dashboards, course materials, or subscription-only content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Static Site Hosting Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a WordPress site owner, I want to host my static WordPress-generated site on AWS infrastructure, so that I can benefit from global CDN performance and enterprise-grade security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user deploys the stack THEN the system SHALL create an S3 bucket with public access blocked
2. WHEN static files are uploaded to the S3 bucket THEN they SHALL be accessible only through CloudFront distribution
3. WHEN a CloudFront distribution is created THEN it SHALL use Origin Access Control (OAC) for secure S3 access
4. WHEN the distribution is configured THEN it SHALL support custom domains with SSL certificates
5. WHEN error conditions occur AND custom error pages are configured THEN the system SHALL serve custom 404 and 403 error pages
6. WHEN error page parameters are left empty THEN the system SHALL omit those error responses entirely
6. WHEN logging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive CloudWatch monitoring

### Requirement 2: Authentication-Protected Content Areas

**User Story:** As a site administrator, I want to protect specific URL paths with authentication, so that only signed-in users can access premium content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN protected paths are configured THEN the system SHALL create CloudFront cache behaviors for each path pattern
2. WHEN an unauthenticated user accesses a protected path THEN they SHALL be redirected to the sign-in page with return URL preservation
3. WHEN a user has valid signed cookies THEN they SHALL access protected content transparently
4. WHEN protected paths are defined THEN the system SHALL support configurable path patterns with no default values (examples: /dashboard, /members, /courses)
5. WHEN path rewriting occurs THEN the system SHALL map protected paths to restricted internal paths for cache behavior routing

### Requirement 3: CloudFront Signed Cookie Authentication

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to use CloudFront signed cookies for authentication, so that content protection happens at the edge for optimal performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL create CloudFront public keys and key groups for cookie verification
2. WHEN cookies are issued THEN they SHALL be signed with RSA-SHA1 cryptography using KMS-encrypted private keys
3. WHEN cookies are set THEN they SHALL include proper security attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
4. WHEN cookie expiration is configured THEN it SHALL align with Cognito refresh token validity
5. WHEN users sign out THEN cookies SHALL be immediately expired with Max-Age=0

### Requirement 4: API Gateway Cookie Issuance Service

**User Story:** As an authentication system integrator, I want a REST API endpoint to issue and manage signed cookies, so that I can integrate with existing authentication flows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API Gateway is deployed THEN it SHALL expose a GET endpoint at /issue-cookie
2. WHEN the API is called THEN it SHALL require AWS IAM authentication for security
3. WHEN CORS requests are made THEN the API SHALL support proper CORS headers with credential support
4. WHEN the API is accessed THEN it SHALL use a custom domain that is a subdomain of the main site domain
5. WHEN cookies are issued THEN the Lambda function SHALL generate properly signed CloudFront cookies

### Requirement 5: Serverless Cookie Signing Function

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want cookie signing to be handled by a serverless Lambda function, so that private keys are never exposed and the system scales automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Lambda function is invoked THEN it SHALL retrieve the encrypted private key from KMS
2. WHEN cookies are signed THEN the function SHALL use built-in RSA cryptography with proper CloudFront cookie format
3. WHEN the function executes THEN it SHALL follow the principle of least privilege with minimal IAM permissions
4. WHEN cryptographic operations are performed THEN they SHALL use the Lambda runtime's native cryptography libraries
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the function SHALL provide comprehensive logging and error handling

### Requirement 6: CloudFront Edge Functions for Request Processing

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want request processing to happen at CloudFront edge locations, so that authentication checks and path rewriting occur with minimal latency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is made to a protected path THEN CloudFront functions SHALL check for valid signed cookies
2. WHEN cookie validation fails THEN the function SHALL redirect to the sign-in page with return URL
3. WHEN cookies are valid THEN the function SHALL rewrite the request path for proper cache behavior routing
4. WHEN path rewriting occurs THEN restricted paths SHALL be mapped back to original paths for S3 origin requests
5. WHEN functions are deployed THEN they SHALL be automatically published and associated with cache behaviors

### Requirement 7: Secure Key Management and Encryption

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all cryptographic keys to be securely managed, so that the system meets enterprise security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RSA key pairs are generated THEN private keys SHALL be encrypted with AWS KMS
2. WHEN private keys are stored THEN they SHALL be kept in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
3. WHEN public keys are configured THEN they SHALL be properly formatted for CloudFront key groups
4. WHEN key rotation is needed THEN the system SHALL support updating keys without service interruption
5. WHEN keys are accessed THEN all operations SHALL be logged for audit purposes

### Requirement 8: DNS and Domain Management

**User Story:** As a site operator, I want automatic DNS configuration, so that my custom domains work immediately after deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DNS creation is enabled THEN the system SHALL automatically create Route53 records
2. WHEN custom domains are configured THEN SSL certificates SHALL be validated and applied
3. WHEN API domains are set THEN they SHALL be configured as subdomains of the main domain
4. WHEN DNS records are created THEN they SHALL include both apex and www subdomain configurations
5. WHEN manual DNS is preferred THEN the system SHALL provide all necessary DNS configuration outputs

### Requirement 9: Monitoring and Observability
