# Requirements Document

## Introduction

WordPress Static Site Guardian is an enterprise-grade AWS solution that enables static WordPress sites to maintain authentication-protected content areas. The system leverages CloudFront signed cookies and Lambda@Edge functions to provide seamless authentication integration while maintaining the performance benefits of static site hosting.

The solution addresses the challenge faced by WordPress site owners who want to serve their sites statically from S3/CloudFront for performance and security benefits, but still need to protect premium content areas like member dashboards, course materials, or subscription-only content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Static Site Hosting Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a WordPress site owner, I want to host my static WordPress-generated site on AWS infrastructure, so that I can benefit from global CDN performance and enterprise-grade security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user deploys the stack THEN the system SHALL create an S3 bucket with public access blocked
2. WHEN static files are uploaded to the S3 bucket THEN they SHALL be accessible only through CloudFront distribution
3. WHEN a CloudFront distribution is created THEN it SHALL use Origin Access Control (OAC) for secure S3 access
4. WHEN the distribution is configured THEN it SHALL support custom domains with SSL certificates
5. WHEN error conditions occur AND custom error pages are configured THEN the system SHALL serve custom 404 and 403 error pages
6. WHEN error page parameters are left empty THEN the system SHALL omit those error responses entirely
6. WHEN logging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive CloudWatch monitoring

### Requirement 2: Authentication-Protected Content Areas

5. WHEN errors occur THEN the function SHALL provide comprehensive logging and error handling
6. WHEN configuration values are needed THEN they SHALL be embedded as constants in code rather than environment variables
7. WHEN JWT verification is performed THEN it SHALL validate signature via cached Cognito JWKS, issuer, expiration, and audience claims

### Requirement 6: CloudFront Edge Functions for Request Processing

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want request processing to happen at CloudFront edge locations, so that authentication checks and path rewriting occur with minimal latency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is made to a protected path THEN CloudFront functions SHALL check for valid signed cookies
2. WHEN cookie validation fails THEN the function SHALL redirect to the sign-in page with return URL
3. WHEN cookies are valid THEN the function SHALL rewrite the request path for proper cache behavior routing
4. WHEN path rewriting occurs THEN restricted paths SHALL be mapped back to original paths for S3 origin requests
5. WHEN functions are deployed THEN they SHALL be automatically published and associated with cache behaviors

### Requirement 7: Secure Key Management and Encryption

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all cryptographic keys to be securely managed, so that the system meets enterprise security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RSA key pairs are generated THEN private keys SHALL be encrypted with AWS KMS
2. WHEN private keys are stored THEN they SHALL be kept in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
3. WHEN public keys are configured THEN they SHALL be properly formatted for CloudFront key groups
4. WHEN key rotation is needed THEN the system SHALL support updating keys without service interruption
