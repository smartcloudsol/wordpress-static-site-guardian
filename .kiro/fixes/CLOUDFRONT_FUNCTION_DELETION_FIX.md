# CloudFront Function Deletion Fix

## Problem
After deleting the CloudFormation stack, the two CloudFront functions (`ViewerRequestFunction` and `PathRewriteFunction`) were not being deleted and remained orphaned in the AWS account.

## Root Cause
CloudFront functions cannot be deleted while they are still associated with a CloudFront distribution. The deletion was failing because:

1. **Function Association**: The functions were still associated with the distribution's cache behaviors
2. **Deletion Order**: CloudFormation was trying to delete the functions before removing their associations
3. **Insufficient Retry Logic**: The function deletion retry logic wasn't handling the "function in use" scenario properly

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced Distribution Update Deletion
Added a new function to remove function associations during `DistributionUpdate` resource deletion:

```python
def remove_function_associations_from_distribution(props):
    """Remove function associations from CloudFront distribution to allow function deletion"""
    
    # Get current distribution configuration
    response = cloudfront.get_distribution_config(Id=distribution_id)
    config = response['DistributionConfig']
    
    # Remove function associations from default cache behavior
    config['DefaultCacheBehavior']['FunctionAssociations'] = {
        'Quantity': 0,
        'Items': []
    }
    
    # Remove function associations from all cache behaviors
    for behavior in config['CacheBehaviors']:
        behavior['FunctionAssociations'] = {
            'Quantity': 0,
            'Items': []
        }
    
    # Update the distribution
    cloudfront.update_distribution(Id=distribution_id, DistributionConfig=config, IfMatch=etag)
```

### 2. Improved Function Deletion Retry Logic
Enhanced the function deletion with better retry handling:

```python
def delete_function_with_retry(function_name, max_retries=10):
    # Increased max retries from 5 to 10
    # Longer wait times (up to 5 minutes) for distribution propagation
    # Better error handling for "function in use" scenarios
```

### 3. Proper Resource Dependencies
Updated the template to ensure proper deletion order:

```yaml
CloudFrontDistributionUpdate:
  Type: AWS::CloudFormation::CustomResource
  Properties:
    # References to both functions create implicit dependencies
    ViewerRequestFunctionArn: !GetAtt ViewerRequestFunction.FunctionARN
    PathRewriteFunctionArn: !GetAtt PathRewriteFunction.FunctionARN
```

### 4. Enhanced Deletion Logic
Modified the `delete_resource` function to handle `DistributionUpdate` deletion:

```python
elif resource_type == 'DistributionUpdate':
    # Remove function associations from distribution before functions are deleted
    remove_function_associations_from_distribution(event['ResourceProperties'])
```

## How It Works

### Deletion Sequence
1. **CloudFormation starts stack deletion**
2. **DistributionUpdate deleted first** (due to dependencies)
   - Removes function associations from distribution
   - Waits for distribution update to propagate (60 seconds)
3. **Functions deleted after** (now safe to delete)
   - Enhanced retry logic handles any remaining "in use" conditions
   - Up to 10 retries with exponential backoff

### Key Improvements
- ✅ **Function Association Removal**: Explicitly removes function associations before deletion
- ✅ **Proper Wait Times**: Allows time for CloudFront distribution updates to propagate
- ✅ **Enhanced Retry Logic**: Better handling of "function in use" errors
- ✅ **Dependency Management**: Ensures correct deletion order through CloudFormation dependencies
- ✅ **Graceful Error Handling**: Continues deletion even if some operations fail

## Benefits

1. **Clean Stack Deletion**: Functions are properly deleted with the stack
2. **No Orphaned Resources**: Prevents leftover CloudFront functions in AWS account
3. **Reliable Deletion**: Handles CloudFront's eventual consistency and propagation delays
4. **Cost Optimization**: Eliminates orphaned resources that could incur costs
5. **Operational Cleanliness**: Maintains clean AWS account state

## Validation
- ✅ Template validates successfully
- ✅ Python syntax validation passes
- ✅ Enhanced retry logic with proper wait times
- ✅ Function association removal logic implemented
- ✅ Proper CloudFormation dependency management

This comprehensive fix ensures that CloudFront functions are properly cleaned up during stack deletion, preventing orphaned resources and maintaining a clean AWS account state.
